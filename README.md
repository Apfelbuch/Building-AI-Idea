# Fraudulent Transaction Detection using Machine Learning
Building AI course project

## Summary
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, employing a dataset containing anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine.

## Background
### Importance 
Identification of fraudulent credit card transactions is crucial to (1) prevent customers from unauthorized charges, (2) prevent financial loss of credit card companies, (3) maintain trust between credit card companies and their customers.
### Motivation
Enhancing security measures to safeguard financial assets.

## How is it used?
### The solution involves
  (1) Preprocessing the data.
  (2) Utilizing supervised machine learning algorithms to generate models.
  (3) Evaluation of the models using Accuracy, ROC-Curve and F1-Score.
### Users
Credit card companies and financial institutions.
### Needs
Real-time monitoring, accuracy, and robustness against evolving fraudulent techniques.

## Data sources and AI methods
### Data Source
  Kaggle dataset with anonymized credit card transactions.
  It contains numerical features like 'Time', 'Amount', and 'Class' (response variable: value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise) labels.
### AI Techniques
  Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
  #### Process steps
  Data import, exploration, manipulation, splitting, model training, evaluation and comparison.

## Challenges
Limitations:
  (1) Inability to access original features due to confidentiality.
  (2) Ethical considerations: Privacy concerns with financial data usage and model biases.

## What next?
### Future enhancements
  (1) Collaboration with financial regulators for standardizing fraud detection protocols.
  (2) Continuous learning and adaptation to new fraud patterns.
To accomplish this, collaboration with domain experts and access to real-time data streams would be invaluable.
